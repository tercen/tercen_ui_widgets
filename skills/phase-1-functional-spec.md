# Phase 1: Functional Specification

**This file is READ-ONLY during app builds. Do NOT modify it. If you encounter a gap or error, note it in the app's `_local/skill-feedback.md` and continue.**

Load this skill when starting a new app. Produce a functional spec document. Do NOT write any code.

## Tercen Design Constraints

MUST follow these rules when designing the UI.

1. **ALL controls go in the left panel.** Main content area is display only (charts, grids, images, canvas). No sliders, buttons, dropdowns, or inputs in the main panel.
2. **Left panel sections scroll vertically.** No tabs. No internal collapse. Sections are always visible and scroll as a single list.
3. **Every section has an icon and UPPERCASE label.** Example: a filter icon with "FILTERS", a settings icon with "SETTINGS".
4. **INFO section is mandatory.** Every app has an INFO section at the bottom of the left panel with a GitHub repository link.
5. **Available control types** (exactly 11): dropdown, slider, range slider, toggle, number input, button, searchable input, text input, checkbox, radio, segmented button. Do not invent new control types.
   - Use **segmented button** for 2-4 mutually exclusive modes that should be always visible.
   - Use **radio** for longer option lists or settings-style selections.
6. **Identify the app type**:
   - Type 1 (Visualization): Tercen → App → Screen (+ download)
   - Type 2 (Interactive): Same as Type 1 + writes data back to Tercen
   - Type 3 (Workflow Manager): Multi-step with Tercen object creation and breakpoints

## Output Rules

- The spec describes WHAT the app does, never HOW it is implemented.
- No Dart code, no pseudo-code, no implementation approach.
- No pixel values, spacing tokens, or colour codes (except domain-specific colours like chart series colours).
- No references to Flutter widgets, Provider, GetIt, or any framework.
- Mock data requirements describe WHAT data is needed and WHERE it comes from, not how to load it.

## Spec Template

Every functional spec follows this structure. All 8 sections are required.

## Discovery Process

Gather information in this order. Adapt questions to the input source (Shiny code, screenshots, verbal description, existing documentation).

### Round 1: Purpose and Data

- What does this app do? Who uses it?
- What domain is this? What does the data represent?
- What data comes from Tercen? What are the projections (.x, .y, .ci, labels, colours)?
- What are the data characteristics (ranges, counts, sparsity)?
- What is in scope? What is explicitly out of scope?
- What app type is this? (Type 1 / Type 2 / Type 3)

### Round 2: UI Design

- Is there existing code, screenshots, or a description to reference?
- If existing UI: evaluate against Tercen design constraints above. What needs to change?
- What sections does the left panel need? What icon and label for each?
- What controls in each section? Type, default, range?
- What does the main content display? (chart, grid, images, canvas, table)
- What interactions does the main content support? (hover, click, select, drag)
- Does the app export anything? (PDF, PNG, CSV, data write-back)

### Round 3: Constraints and Assumptions

- Performance requirements? Expected data volume?
- What example/mock data is available?
- Any domain-specific terminology to define?

### Round 4: Draft and Review

- Write the complete spec following the template above.
- Present to user for review.
- Iterate until approved.

## Question Efficiency

- Do NOT dump all questions at once. Ask 3-4 per round.
- Skip questions already answered by provided material (Shiny code, screenshots, etc.).
- When reviewing existing code/UI, proactively identify Tercen constraint violations and propose fixes.
- Consolidate related questions.
